APPLICATION INTENTION
-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~
The purpose of the ChatCat app is to provide a communication tool which allows users to
have conversations on private databases hosted for various companies. This may function as
internal chat for businesses; a channel for customer relations; or open and public chat groups.

The communication tool connects through a database which is shared between web, iOS, and android
platforms! Currently the database used to connect the applications is the Firebase host.
